#+title: MultiPPL's Trees That Grow library

This library provides a procmacro for defining and managing the Trees That Grow
"TTG" abstraction for the compiler passes of MultiPPL. The idea is to have a
generalized IR which is shared across all compiler passes. This sub-library
hard-codes the passes used in multippl and generalizing the procmacro for
broader use is left to future work.

That Grow/, Journal of Universal Computer Science.

#+title: MultiPPL: A Probabilistic Multi-language Framework

MultiPPL is compiler outlining sound interoperation between two syntactically
different probabilistic programming languages: an approximate language using
importance sampling, and an exact language using BDDs for knowledge compilation.

* Evaluating  benchmarks
- test a run:
#+begin_example bash
nix build .#docker-bench
(docker load < result)

docker run -v $PWD/dockerdata:/data multippl-bench:latest all --psi-runs 2 --psi-threads 2 --num-threads 4 --num-runs 1)
#+end_example

- Residential memory is highest for psi (17.2G for the ~bayesnet/alarm~ evaluation).
- 10 runs should give a ballpark figure for the 100 run evaluation.
